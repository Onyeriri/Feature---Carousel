1. Planning.
2. Building.
3. Debugging.

## Planning

This is the first stage in this very project cycle. Here I try to make research about that aforementioned feature. During my research I tried to see various online web application with the same feature as what am trying to work on.

Therefore with this I was able to see different project that has similar feature in part or full functionality with the project feature that I will be working on.

Moreover, after visiting different web application with similar functionality. I started the process of planning how to implement different major parts of carousel functionality I have broken down. For instance

1. How to stack different images together.
2. How to automatically display different images one after another.
3. How to display different images on the click of buttons **left** and **right** to show the correct image.
4. How to implement indicator button.
5. How to display the progress of the carousel feature using different buttons.
6. How to implement change of image by clicking the indicator button.
